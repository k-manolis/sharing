and evoution


At the moment and as the company is on the early stages of the data transformation, we need a Data Engineer with a more software engineering background having good knowledge of programming principals experience with Python and SQL and a very good knowledge of distributed processing frameworks (e.g Apache Spark, Apache Storm), message brokers (e.g Kafka, Kinesis) and streaming solutions (e.g Spark Structured Streaming, Apache Flink). Basic knowledge regarding building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, testing, db experience.

As the team evolves and the focus of the company is shifting more and more towards the data, there will be a need for Data Engineers with domain experience. These engineers are responsible for cleansing, organizing, and transforming data. Their job also entails building and maintaining complex data models. These engineers mainly have a Data Warehouse or BI background but are also familiar with some distributed processing frameworks (e.g Apache Spark), testing, CI/CD and of course have the domain expertise in order to deal with the stakeholders' requests.
