## Key Interactions:

- **Tech Lead** and **Senior Engineers**: Senior engineers work closely with the tech lead on implementation and technical decisions. Senior engineers contribute code and expertise, while the tech lead focuses on guiding the team technically and aligning with the broader technical direction.
  
- **Tech Lead** and **Solution Architect**: The tech lead ensures that the team’s implementation follows the architectural guidelines set by the solution architect. The solution architect helps define the architecture and ensures long-term technical alignment.

- **Product Owner** and **Tech Lead**: The product owner ensures the team works on features that provide business value, while the tech lead ensures that those features are technically feasible and well-implemented.

- **Chapter Lead** and Engineers: The chapter lead focuses on the development of engineers across squads or teams, ensuring their skills and career progression align with the needs of the organization, while helping solve people and performance challenges.

In an Agile squad, each of these roles plays a complementary part in ensuring that the team delivers high-quality, value-driven software while promoting growth and alignment in the technical direction.
